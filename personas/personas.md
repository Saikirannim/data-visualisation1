# David Hu
**Local Government**
**Age**: 62
**Gender**: M

David works in the local government monitoring air quality. However, he doesn't have very many technical skills, and is used to seeing the data as printed tables that he has other people compile for him.

#### Goals and motivations
- To understand how much pollution is caused by different sectors and what sectors local government should focus on 
- To be able to track progress over time to see what effect policies are having on pollution

#### Issues
- David has limited experience with modern computing interfaces so systems that he uses need to be intuitive and easy to understand, with clear patterns and design.

# Nīkau Hurst
**Employee in Agrico Chemicals**
**Age**: 27
**Gender**: M

Nīkau works at Agrico Chemicals monitoring the impact of the company's products across New Zealand. He is experienced at conducting tests within his own corporate environment but now wants to see wider trends at play within the industry and the nation and compare these to internal figures.

#### Goals and motivations
- To be able to understand how his company's products contribute to pollution
- To be able to see the data in a way that can be compared to internal data

#### Issues
- Nīkau is only really interested in the specific industry he is working in (agrichemicals) so needs a way to be able to see just that data, or at the very least distinguish it.

# Chelsea Fraser
**Farmer**
**Age**: 47
**Gender**: F

Chelsea is a farmer who uses a variety of chemicals, and farms cows that can contribute to methane emissions. She is a low-knowledge user, having not much experience with the topic of pollution or the environment but wishes to find out more.

#### Goals and motivations
- Chelsea doesn't really know much about pollution and has been farming the same way her whole life. She wants to gain a greater understanding of how her activities contribute to pollution
- She also wants to see how her industry stacks up against other industries. This means she needs to be able to easily compare different industries' contributions

#### Issues
- Chelsea doesn't really know about technical terms such as PM2.5 etc. Therefore either an explanation or aggregated total pollution would help her.

# Ramesh Kumar
**Associate Professor in the School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences at VUW**
**Age**: 41
**Gender**: M

Ramesh is a researcher who needs easy access to air quality information. He has plenty of experience working with data applications like this and typically looks at things in a "big-picture" format as opposed to needing individual data points. This also means he is experienced in reading graphs and parsing data.

#### Goals and motivations
- Be able to know what areas have the most change or the most pollution at a glance to see where he can focus his research on
- Be able to look at "big picture" data and understand patterns across multiple datapoints

#### Issues
- As a researcher, accuracy is important so he needs to be assured that the data is displayed in a way where it is clear what different quanties mean in relation to each other
